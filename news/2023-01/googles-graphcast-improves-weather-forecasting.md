In 2023, Google DeepMind introduced GraphCast, a machine learning model capable of predicting weather conditions up to 10 days in advance. GraphCast demonstrated higher accuracy and faster performance compared to existing dynamical models, accurately forecasting cyclone tracks and associated risks days earlier than traditional methods.

## What Happened

In 2023, Google DeepMind unveiled GraphCast, a machine learning model designed to predict global weather conditions up to 10 days ahead. This model outperformed existing dynamical models in both accuracy and speed, providing earlier warnings for severe weather events such as cyclones.

## Why It Matters

Accurate and timely weather forecasts are crucial for disaster preparedness, resource management, and public safety. GraphCast's ability to deliver precise predictions days in advance represents a significant advancement in meteorology, potentially saving lives and reducing economic losses associated with extreme weather events.

## Who's Involved

- Google DeepMind: Developed and open-sourced GraphCast, contributing to advancements in AI-driven weather forecasting.

## Technical Details

- Model: GraphCast utilizes graph neural networks to predict 227 key dynamic variables representing atmospheric conditions at 6-hour intervals over a 10-day period.
- Data: Trained on four decades of historical weather data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).
- Performance: Outperformed ECMWF's deterministic forecasting system, HRES, on 89.3% of the 2,760 target variables and lead times evaluated. Additionally, GraphCast is orders of magnitude faster, generating a 10-day forecast in under 60 seconds on Cloud TPU hardware.

## Benchmark Results

GraphCast demonstrated superior accuracy compared to the ECMWF's HRES system on various atmospheric variables, including temperature, wind speed, and pressure. Specific benchmark results are detailed in the original publications.

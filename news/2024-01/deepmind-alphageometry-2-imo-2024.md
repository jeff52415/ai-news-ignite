### Who's Involved

- **DeepMind:** The AI research division of Alphabet, responsible for developing AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2.
- **Prof. Sir Timothy Gowers:** A Fields Medalist who evaluated the AI systems' performance during the IMO.
- **Dr. Joseph Myers:** A two-time IMO gold medalist who also assessed the AI systems' solutions.

### Technical Details

- **AlphaProof:** A reinforcement-learning-based system for formal mathematical reasoning, combining a pre-trained language model with the AlphaZero algorithm. It was trained to prove mathematical statements in the formal language Lean by generating and verifying solutions.

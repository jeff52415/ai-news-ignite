###  What Happened

A comprehensive survey titled "A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications" was published on arXiv on June 14, 2025. The paper analyzes over 80 AI-driven deep research systems that have emerged since 2023, including both commercial and open-source implementations. The authors propose a novel hierarchical taxonomy to categorize these systems based on four fundamental technical dimensions:

1. **Foundation Models and Reasoning Engines**: The core models and reasoning capabilities that drive the system's intelligence.
2. **Tool Utilization and Environmental Interaction**: The system's ability to interact with external tools and its environment.
3. **Task Planning and Execution Control**: The system's capacity to plan and execute tasks autonomously.
4. **Knowledge Synthesis and Output Generation**: The system's proficiency in synthesizing information and generating outputs.

The survey also explores the architectural patterns, implementation approaches, and domain-specific adaptations of these systems across various applications, including academic research, scientific discovery, business intelligence, financial analysis, educational applications, and personal knowledge management.

###  Why It Matters

This survey is significant because it provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the rapidly evolving field of AI-powered deep research systems. By categorizing these systems into a structured taxonomy, the paper offers insights into their capabilities, implementation strategies, and the challenges they face. This understanding is crucial for both the theoretical advancement of AI-augmented knowledge work and the practical development of more capable, responsible, and accessible research technologies.

###  Who's Involved

The survey was conducted by Renjun Xu and Jingwen Peng from Zhejiang University, China. They analyzed over 80 AI-driven deep research systems, including commercial implementations like OpenAI/DeepResearch, Gemini/DeepResearch, Perplexity/DeepResearch, and numerous open-source alternatives.

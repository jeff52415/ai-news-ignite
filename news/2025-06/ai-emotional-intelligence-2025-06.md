**Summary:** Research from the University of Geneva and the University of Bern demonstrates that AI systems like GPT-4 achieve 82% accuracy on emotional intelligence (EI) tests, significantly surpassing the 56% average score of humans. The study evaluated six popular generative AI models across five emotional intelligence assessments, highlighting AI's potential to understand and manage emotions better than humansâ€”paving the way for applications in mental health, education, coaching, and customer service.

### ðŸ”¹ What Happened

A joint study by the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the University of Bern (UniBE) assessed the emotional intelligence capabilities of six AI models, including GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Haiku. Using five validated emotional intelligence tests designed for human populations, the AI systems achieved an average accuracy of about 82%, outperforming human test-takers who scored 56% on average.

### ðŸ”¹ Why It Matters

Emotional intelligence has traditionally been considered a uniquely human trait critical to social functioning. This groundbreaking finding challenges that notion, suggesting that AI can recognize, comprehend, and even anticipate emotional responses effectively. Such capabilities open new avenues for AI-assisted mental health support, personalized education, leadership coaching, and enhanced customer service experiences.

### What Happened

A recent study by the University of Geneva and the University of Bern evaluated six generative AI models—including ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-o1, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Copilot 365, Claude 3.5 Haiku, and DeepSeek V3—using five standard emotional intelligence (EI) assessments. The AI models achieved an average accuracy of 82%, significantly outperforming the human average of 56%.

### Why It Matters

This finding challenges the traditional view that emotional intelligence is a uniquely human trait. The superior performance of AI models suggests they can effectively understand and respond to emotional cues, opening new possibilities for AI applications in emotionally sensitive domains such as education, coaching, and conflict management.

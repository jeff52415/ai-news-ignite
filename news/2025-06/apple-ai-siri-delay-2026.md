### Summary
Apple's anticipated overhaul of its AI-powered Siri has been delayed and is now projected for release in spring 2026 alongside the iOS 26.4 update. Despite this delay and changes in leadership, Apple introduced new AI capabilities during WWDC 2025, including AI-powered call screening, voicemail summaries, and an AI Workout Buddy in WatchOS 26.

### ðŸ”¹ What Happened

Cliff Asness, co-founder of AQR Capital Management, has announced a strategic shift in the firm's investment approach by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning into their quantitative trading strategies. This move marks a departure from their traditional human-built, rules-based models. Asness acknowledged that the firm has "surrendered more to the machines," allowing data-driven decisions to guide portfolio adjustments and market pattern identification, even when the reasoning behind some trades isn't immediately clear. This transition has led to improved returns following the "quant winter" of 2018-2020, during which AQR's assets had significantly declined. Notably, their top-performing hedge fund strategies, Apex and Delphi, achieved annualized net returns of 19% and 14.6%, respectively.

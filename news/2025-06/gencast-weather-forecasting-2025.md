### What Happened

Google DeepMind unveiled GenCast, an AI-driven weather forecasting model that surpasses traditional systems in predicting extreme weather events. GenCast employs ensemble-based probabilistic forecasting, generating a range of possible weather scenarios to provide more accurate and reliable predictions.

### Why It Matters

As climate change leads to more frequent and severe extreme weather events, accurate forecasting becomes crucial for public safety and disaster preparedness. GenCast's advanced capabilities offer a significant improvement over existing models, enabling better anticipation and response to unprecedented weather phenomena.

### Who's Involved

- **Google DeepMind**: Developed GenCast, aiming to revolutionize weather forecasting with AI.
- **European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)**: Their ensemble forecasting system, ENS, was the benchmark that GenCast outperformed.

### Technical Details

- **Model**: GenCast, a diffusion-based ensemble model.
- **Training Data**: Four decades of historical weather data from ECMWF’s ERA5 archive, including variables like temperature, wind speed, and pressure at various altitudes.
- **Forecasting Method**: Ensemble-based probabilistic forecasting, generating multiple predictions to represent different possible weather scenarios.
- **Performance**: Outperformed ECMWF’s ENS in 97.2% of 1,320 forecast metrics evaluated, including predictions of extreme heat, cold, and high wind speeds.
